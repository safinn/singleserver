# Local Real-Dependency E2E

This test spins up disposable Linux hosts in Docker Desktop and runs the real
Single Server installer against them. It uses real Tailscale, Cloudflare,
GitHub, Docker, and Kamal instead of fake provider services.

The test is intentionally serial and stateful. It creates Cloudflare tunnels,
Cloudflare DNS records, Git commits, and app deploys. Each distro gets one
fresh host, then the selected app cases run sequentially on that host.

The runner deletes the active Cloudflare tunnel during teardown. Before each
run it also sweeps old, disconnected E2E tunnels whose names start with
`singleserver-singleserver-e2e-`, so interrupted runs do not slowly accumulate
dead tunnels in Cloudflare.

Tailscale is the one deliberately reused provider state. The runner keeps a
small Tailscale state directory per distro under `test/e2e-local-real/state/`
so repeated local runs keep the same `.ts.net` name and cached Funnel
certificate state instead of asking Let's Encrypt for a new identity every run.

## Setup

Copy the example env file and fill it with real test credentials:

```sh
cp test/e2e-local-real/.env.example test/e2e-local-real/.env
chmod 600 test/e2e-local-real/.env
```

Required values:

- `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`: token that can manage DNS and Cloudflare Tunnels.
- `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`: account used to create the test tunnel.
- `TEST_ZONE`: Cloudflare zone used for temporary app domains.
- `TAILSCALE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`, `TAILSCALE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`, and
  `TAILSCALE_TAG`: OAuth client used to generate pre-authorized Tailscale auth
  keys for E2E hosts. `TAILSCALE_AUTHKEY` is still accepted as a fallback.
- `GITHUB_APP_ID`, `GITHUB_APP_SLUG`, `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, and
  `GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH`: credentials for a dedicated GitHub App installed
  on the test repository. The runner repoints this App's webhook, so use a test
  App, not the production one.
- `GITHUB_TEST_REPO`: repository used for test commits and deploys. The runner
  creates it if missing.

Optional values:

- `TAILSCALE_API_TOKEN`: used to create the OAuth client/tag and for future
  cleanup helpers.
- `GITHUB_PUSH_TOKEN`: token `gh`/`git` use to create and push commits to
  `GITHUB_TEST_REPO`. If omitted, the runner uses the currently authenticated
  `gh` account.

The runner expects local `curl`, `docker`, `gh`, `git`, `go`, `dig`, `openssl`,
and `python3`.

The local `.env`, generated work directory, and Tailscale state cache are
ignored by git. To keep credentials outside the repo, set `E2E_ENV_FILE` to an
absolute path and the runner loads that file instead of
`test/e2e-local-real/.env`.

## Structure

The E2E harness is split by responsibility:

- `run.sh` loads configuration, validates local tools, starts the artifact
  server, and runs the distro matrix.
- `lib/providers.sh` contains GitHub App, Cloudflare, Tailscale, JSON, and
  assertion helpers.
- `lib/host.sh` owns disposable host lifecycle, installer checks, provider
  connection, and cleanup.
- `lib/cases.sh` creates the test apps and exercises app deploy, webhook,
  command, domain, env, storage, backup, restore, and remove flows.

## Tailscale OAuth Setup

Create a Tailscale OAuth client with the `auth_keys` scope and the tag used by
`TAILSCALE_TAG`, usually `tag:singleserver-e2e`. The E2E runner uses this OAuth
client to create a one-hour, one-off, pre-authorized auth key when a distro host
does not already have usable cached state.

The tag must exist in the tailnet policy file, and it must be allowed to use
Funnel:

```json
{
  "tagOwners": {
    "tag:singleserver-e2e": ["autogroup:admin"]
  },
  "nodeAttrs": [
    {
      "target": ["tag:singleserver-e2e"],
      "attr": ["funnel"]
    }
  ]
}
```

The default Tailscale hostnames are `singleserver-e2e-ubuntu`,
`singleserver-e2e-<distro>`, and so on. Set
`SINGLESERVER_E2E_RESET_TAILSCALE_STATE=1` to log out and remove the cached
state for a run. That is useful when debugging auth, but it may force Tailscale
to request a new Funnel certificate.

## GitHub App Bootstrap

If you do not have test GitHub App credentials yet, run:

```sh
test/e2e-local-real/bootstrap-github-app.sh
```

The helper starts a temporary Single Server container, exposes setup through
Tailscale Funnel, and opens the GitHub App manifest flow. GitHub still requires
a browser approval step. Install the app on the test repository, then copy the
printed values into `test/e2e-local-real/.env`.

## Run

```sh
test/e2e-local-real/run.sh
```

By default this runs the Ubuntu, Debian, Amazon Linux 2023, and Rocky Linux 9
host images and all app cases:

```sh
E2E_DISTROS="ubuntu debian amazonlinux rocky"
E2E_CASES="dockerfile static static-build node"
```

`E2E_DISTROS` and `E2E_CASES` also accept comma-separated values. To run one
fast slice:

```sh
E2E_DISTROS=amazonlinux E2E_CASES=node test/e2e-local-real/run.sh
```

The run verifies:

- Local installer downloads the just-built binary.
- Re-running the installer on an already-installed host preserves base config,
  SSH keys, and service wiring.
- Docker, Kamal, Tailscale, cloudflared, registry, deploy user, and daemon boot.
- Tailscale Funnel exposes the GitHub webhook endpoint.
- Cloudflare Tunnel and DNS route a temporary app domain.
- GitHub App webhook URL is updated to the current Funnel URL.
- A Dockerfile app is deployed from GitHub.
- A static app without a Dockerfile is deployed with a generated Dockerfile.
- A built static app without a Dockerfile is deployed with a generated Node
  build stage and a generated static runtime stage.
- A Node app without a Dockerfile is deployed with a generated Dockerfile.
- The Dockerfile app covers an external `/up` healthcheck.
- The static app covers a generated Dockerfile with generated `/ready` container readiness.
- The Node app covers generated Node containerization with `/readyz` container readiness and no external healthcheck URL.
- Pushed GitHub commits trigger webhook deploys for every app case.
- Re-running the installer after a live app exists preserves `apps.yml`,
  Tailscale Funnel URL, GitHub App credentials, Cloudflare tunnel state,
  cloudflared config, and the live app route.
- The command coverage scenario exercises logs, runtime logs, env vars,
  generated config edits, domain aliases, storage, backup, and restore.
- The app is removed and the temporary DNS record is cleaned up.

For app marker checks, the runner tries the public Cloudflare edge whenever the
temporary hostname has published DNS. If the Cloudflare API has accepted the
record but the new test zone has not published the hostname yet, the runner
falls back to the same host/path through Kamal on the local test host. `doctor`
still verifies the Cloudflare DNS record and Tunnel route through the real
provider APIs.

Supported distro images live in `test/e2e-local-real/images/`. To add another
distro later, add `test/e2e-local-real/images/<name>.Dockerfile` and include
`<name>` in `E2E_DISTROS`.

Set `SINGLESERVER_E2E_CLOUDFLARE_TUNNEL_CLEANUP_MIN_AGE_SECONDS` to change the
stale tunnel sweep age. The default is `21600` seconds, or 6 hours. Set
`SINGLESERVER_E2E_SKIP_CLOUDFLARE_TUNNEL_SWEEP=1` to disable the preflight
sweep for a run.

Set `SINGLESERVER_E2E_KEEP_CONTAINER=1` to keep the disposable host after a
failed run for debugging.
