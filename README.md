# Single Server

Single Server is a tiny deploy daemon for running many small apps on one server.

It receives GitHub App `push` webhooks, checks a central allowlist, fetches the exact pushed SHA, and runs Kamal on the host.
All `singleserver` commands are run on that host over SSH.

For the intended user experience and roadmap, see
[Working Backwards: The Single Server User Experience](docs/working-backwards.md).
For the marketing homepage, see [www/index.html](www/index.html).

## Naming

The product name is **Single Server**. The repository and service slug are `singleserver`, matching `singleserver.com`.

```text
Product:     Single Server
Repo:        dvassallo/singleserver
Binary:      singleserver
Daemon:      singleserver.service
GitHub App:  single-server
```

## Install

Run this as root on a Linux server:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://singleserver.com/install.sh | sh
```

The installer downloads the hosted Linux binary by default. Set
`SINGLESERVER_INSTALL_FROM_SOURCE=1` to build from a Git checkout instead.

## Minimal config

```yaml
apps:
  - dvassallo/sillyface-games
  - dvassallo/fullsend
```

The repo name drives the defaults:

```text
app name:  repository name
checkout:  /srv/repos/<app>
deploy:    kamal setup -q on first deploy, kamal redeploy -q after that
branch:    repository default branch from the webhook payload
kamal:     generated from conventions unless config/deploy.yml is tracked
```

App names must be unique on the server because they drive checkout paths, Kamal
service names, containers, storage paths, and inferred domains. If two GitHub
owners have a repo with the same name, add one of them with `--name` or set a
different `name` in `apps.yml`.

Hostnames must also be unique across apps. A domain can route to one app at a
time; use `singleserver domains remove` before assigning it somewhere else.

Use an object only when an app needs overrides:

```yaml
apps:
  - repo: dvassallo/fullsend
    branch: master
    healthcheck: https://fullsend.game/up
    hosts:
      - fullsend.game
      - fullsend.assetstacks.com
```

By convention, a repo needs a `Dockerfile`, but it does not need a Kamal config.
If the repo tracks `config/deploy.yml`, Single Server uses it as-is. Otherwise,
Single Server writes a temporary `config/deploy.yml` for the deploy and removes it
after Kamal exits.

Generated Kamal config defaults:

```text
service/image:      app name
server host:        127.0.0.1
ssh user/key:       deploy, /root/.ssh/id_ed25519
registry:           127.0.0.1:5555
builder:            local Docker builder for the server architecture
proxy app_port:     80
proxy ssl:          false
proxy healthcheck:  /up
timeouts:           deploy 10s, drain 1s
```

Optional app overrides for the generated config:

```yaml
apps:
  - repo: smallbets/userbase-homepage
    branch: master
    hosts:
      - userbase.com
      - www.userbase.com
      - userbase.dev
      - www.userbase.dev
    app_port: 80
    healthcheck_path: /up
    healthcheck: https://userbase.com/up
```

## Host secrets

Secrets live on the server, not in app repositories.

```text
/etc/singleserver/apps.yml
/etc/singleserver/singleserver.env
/etc/singleserver/github-app.json
/etc/singleserver/github-app.private-key.pem
```

Required environment:

```sh
SINGLESERVER_CONFIG=/etc/singleserver/apps.yml
SINGLESERVER_STATE_DIR=/etc/singleserver
SINGLESERVER_PORT=8787
SINGLESERVER_PUBLIC_URL=https://hooks.singleserver.com
```

The GitHub App setup stores its webhook secret and private key in `/etc/singleserver`, so app repositories do not need GitHub Actions secrets, deploy keys, or repo-level webhooks.

## GitHub App

The GitHub App needs:

- repository contents: read
- commit statuses: write
- event subscription: push

Install it with access to all repositories, then let `apps.yml` be the deployment allowlist.

If repositories live under multiple GitHub owners, the app must be public/installable, then installed on each owner account or organization that contains deployable repositories. Single Server still only deploys repositories listed in `apps.yml`.

The daemon includes a one-time setup page:

```text
https://hooks.singleserver.com/setup/github-app?token=<setup-token>
```

That page creates the GitHub App from a manifest, exchanges GitHub's callback code, and stores the app credentials under `/etc/singleserver`.

## Operator Commands

Install the daemon binary as both `/usr/local/bin/singleserverd` and `/usr/local/bin/singleserver`.

```sh
ssh root@203.0.113.10
singleserver init
singleserver list
singleserver status
singleserver add https://github.com/owner/repo
singleserver deploy dvassallo/fullsend
singleserver render-deploy smallbets/userbase-homepage
singleserver logs fullsend
singleserver domains add fullsend play.example.com
singleserver storage enable fullsend --mount /storage
singleserver backup fullsend
singleserver restore fullsend 20260608T181500Z --yes
singleserver remove fullsend --delete-repo --delete-storage --yes
```

`singleserver github connect --public` creates a public/installable GitHub App
manifest for setups that deploy repositories under more than one GitHub owner.
Without `--public`, the setup flow creates a private GitHub App for the owner
that creates it.

`singleserver add <github-url>` validates GitHub App access, checks the repo's
default branch and `Dockerfile`, appends the normalized `owner/repo` to
`/etc/singleserver/apps.yml`, validates the generated Kamal config, deploys the
current branch tip, and runs `doctor` afterward. When Cloudflare is connected
and no host is provided, the default app domain is a DNS-safe app label plus the
connected zone, such as `my-app.example.com` or `singleserver-com.example.com`.
Pass `--no-deploy` to configure the app and wait for the next push or manual
deploy.

`singleserver deploy <owner/repo|app> [ref]` runs the same deploy path as a push webhook. If `ref` is omitted, Single Server deploys the configured branch or the repository default branch.

`singleserver render-deploy <owner/repo|app>` prints the generated Kamal `deploy.yml`
for a configured app. It does not inspect or modify the app repository.

`singleserver domains add <app> <domain>` and `singleserver domains remove <app>
<domain>` update `apps.yml`, Cloudflare DNS, Cloudflare Tunnel routing, and then
deploy the app so Kamal picks up the changed proxy hosts. Pass `--no-deploy` to
stage the domain change without applying it to the running app immediately.
`singleserver domains verify [app]` checks resolver DNS, Cloudflare CNAME targets
when credentials are available, and Cloudflare Tunnel routes.

`singleserver env set <app> KEY=value` and `singleserver env unset <app> KEY`
update server-side app secrets. Env changes are injected by Kamal on the next
deploy, so the command prints the deploy command to run when you are ready.

`singleserver storage enable <app>` creates the host storage directory, updates
`apps.yml`, and deploys the app so Kamal mounts it into the running container.
Pass `--no-deploy` to stage the storage config without applying it immediately.

`singleserver backup <app>` archives the app's configured persistent storage
under `/srv/backups/<app>`. SQLite database files are copied with SQLite's backup
API before the archive is written. `singleserver restore <app> <backup-id> --yes`
replaces the storage directory, keeps the previous copy next to it, and restarts
the app containers unless `--no-restart` is passed.

`singleserver remove <app>` removes config, routes, and containers. It keeps the
repo checkout and persistent storage by default. Pass `--delete-repo --yes` or
`--delete-storage --yes` to delete those files explicitly.

## Adding An App

1. Install the Single Server GitHub App on the repository owner, if it is not already installed.
2. Make sure the repository contains a `Dockerfile`.
3. Add it from the server:

```sh
singleserver add https://github.com/owner/repo
```

Future pushes to the configured branch deploy automatically.

## Logs

```sh
journalctl -u singleserver.service -f
