# Working Backwards: The Single Server User Experience

This document describes the user experience we want for Single Server before every
piece of it exists. Treat it as both user documentation and a product roadmap.

The goal is simple: start with a blank VPS from Hetzner, DigitalOcean, AWS,
Azure, or any other provider, then deploy many small GitHub projects to it with
fast, isolated, repeatable deploys.

## The Ideal Outcome

A user should be able to provision a new server and deploy their first app with
three commands and one GitHub browser approval:

```sh
ssh root@203.0.113.10
curl -fsSL https://singleserver.com/install.sh | sh
singleserver init --domain deploy.example.com --email me@example.com
singleserver add me/my-app --host my-app.example.com --deploy
```

After that, every push to the configured branch deploys automatically.

The app repository should only need:

- A `Dockerfile`
- A web process listening on one port, default `80`
- A health endpoint, default `/up`

It should not need GitHub Actions workflows, deploy keys, repo-level secrets,
Kamal config, or per-repo runner setup.

## Concepts

Single Server has four moving parts:

- **Server:** one VPS running Docker, Kamal, cloudflared or direct HTTPS, and the
  Single Server daemon.
- **GitHub App:** the event source and deploy credential provider. Push webhooks
  trigger deploys; installation tokens fetch code and set commit statuses.
- **`apps.yml`:** the allowlist. Only repositories in this file can deploy, even
  if the GitHub App is installed broadly.
- **App containers:** every project runs in its own Docker container behind the
  host proxy.

Single Server should feel like a tiny PaaS you own, not like a pile of bespoke
shell scripts.

## Blank Server Setup

### 1. Create A Server

Create a small Linux server with a public IPv4 address. Ubuntu LTS is the default
target.

Minimum recommended starting point:

```text
2 vCPU
2 GB RAM
40 GB disk
Ubuntu LTS
```

For many small apps, static sites, and SQLite-backed Node/Bun apps, a larger box
can host dozens of projects comfortably.

### 2. Install Single Server

Ideal command:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://singleserver.com/install.sh | sh
```

The installer should:

- Create a `deploy` user
- Install Docker
- Install Kamal
- Install cloudflared, Caddy, or the selected ingress adapter
- Install `/usr/local/bin/singleserver`
- Install and start `singleserver.service`
- Create `/etc/singleserver`
- Create `/etc/singleserver/apps.yml`
- Create `/etc/singleserver/singleserver.env`
- Run `singleserver doctor`

The command should be safe to rerun.

### 3. Initialize The Host

Ideal command:

```sh
singleserver init --domain deploy.example.com --email me@example.com
```

This should configure the public webhook/control URL and choose an ingress mode.

Recommended default:

```sh
singleserver init \
  --domain deploy.example.com \
  --email me@example.com \
  --ingress cloudflare
```

Direct-ingress mode should also exist for users who do not use Cloudflare:

```sh
singleserver init \
  --domain deploy.example.com \
  --email me@example.com \
  --ingress direct
```

In direct mode, Single Server should bind to the public server through a local
reverse proxy and manage TLS certificates.

### 4. Connect GitHub

Ideal command:

```sh
singleserver github connect
```

This should open or print a GitHub URL that creates or installs the Single Server
GitHub App with the minimum permissions:

- Contents: read
- Commit statuses: write
- Events: push

The user should install the app on all repositories or selected repositories.
Single Server should still treat `apps.yml` as the deployment allowlist.

After the browser approval, the CLI should write:

```text
/etc/singleserver/github-app.json
/etc/singleserver/github-app.private-key.pem
```

Then it should run:

```sh
singleserver doctor
```

## Adding Apps

### Add And Deploy

Ideal command:

```sh
singleserver add me/my-app --host my-app.example.com --deploy
```

This should:

- Verify the GitHub App can access `me/my-app`
- Detect the default branch
- Check that the repo contains a `Dockerfile`
- Add the app to `/etc/singleserver/apps.yml`
- Configure DNS for `my-app.example.com`, if a DNS provider is connected
- Render and validate the generated Kamal config
- Deploy the current branch tip
- Run the app healthcheck
- Set the GitHub commit status
- Show the live URL

Expected output:

```text
my-app github_installation ok id=123456
my-app default_branch ok main
my-app dockerfile ok Dockerfile on main
my-app dns ok my-app.example.com
my-app deploy_config ok generated from conventions
my-app config ok added to /etc/singleserver/apps.yml
my-app deploy ok 4280ms
my-app healthcheck ok https://my-app.example.com/up
```

### Add Without Deploying

```sh
singleserver add me/my-app --host my-app.example.com
```

This should configure the app but wait for the next push or manual deploy.

### Add With Overrides

```sh
singleserver add me/my-app \
  --host my-app.example.com \
  --branch production \
  --app-port 3000 \
  --healthcheck-path /health \
  --healthcheck https://my-app.example.com/health \
  --deploy
```

Most apps should not need overrides.

## App Contract

Single Server should keep the app contract small.

Required:

- The repo has a `Dockerfile`.
- The container starts a web server.
- The container listens on the configured app port, default `80`.
- The app has a healthcheck path, default `/up`.

Optional:

- `config/deploy.yml` for apps that need a custom Kamal config.
- A mounted storage directory for SQLite or uploaded files.
- Environment variables managed centrally by Single Server.

Example static-site `Dockerfile`:

```Dockerfile
FROM nginx:alpine
COPY dist /usr/share/nginx/html
```

Example Node/Bun app shape:

```Dockerfile
FROM oven/bun:1
WORKDIR /app
COPY package.json bun.lock ./
RUN bun install --frozen-lockfile
COPY . .
ENV PORT=3000
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["bun", "start"]
```

Then add it with:

```sh
singleserver add me/my-node-app --host app.example.com --app-port 3000 --deploy
```

## Managing Apps

### List Apps

```sh
singleserver list
```

Ideal output:

```text
my-app  me/my-app  branch=main  hosts=my-app.example.com  status=ok
```

### Check The Server

```sh
singleserver doctor
```

This should verify:

- Daemon health
- Config validity
- GitHub App installation access
- App checkouts
- Deploy config source
- Last deploy result
- Public healthchecks
- Disk space
- Docker health
- Proxy/ingress health
- DNS routing

### Deploy Manually

```sh
singleserver deploy me/my-app
singleserver deploy me/my-app abc1234
```

Manual deploys should use the same path as push-triggered deploys.

### View Logs

```sh
singleserver logs
singleserver logs my-app
singleserver logs my-app --follow
```

The default view should show deploy logs. App runtime logs should be available
with an explicit flag:

```sh
singleserver logs my-app --runtime
```

### Manage Domains

```sh
singleserver domains add my-app my-app.example.com
singleserver domains remove my-app old.example.com
```

Changing domains should update central config, DNS when possible, and the proxy.

### Manage Environment Variables

```sh
singleserver env set my-app DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///storage/app.db
singleserver env list my-app
singleserver env unset my-app OLD_KEY
```

Secrets should live on the server, not in GitHub repositories.

### Manage Storage

```sh
singleserver storage enable my-app --mount /storage
singleserver backup my-app
singleserver restore my-app backup-id
```

SQLite apps should have a first-class backup path.

### Remove An App

```sh
singleserver remove my-app
```

This should stop the container, remove proxy routes, optionally remove DNS, and
remove the app from `apps.yml`. It should ask before deleting persistent storage.

### Upgrade Single Server

```sh
singleserver upgrade
```

This should download the latest release, restart the service, and run
`singleserver doctor`.

## Files On The Server

Ideal layout:

```text
/etc/singleserver/apps.yml
/etc/singleserver/singleserver.env
/etc/singleserver/github-app.json
/etc/singleserver/github-app.private-key.pem
/srv/repos/<app>
/srv/storage/<app>
/var/log/singleserver
```

The user should rarely edit these files by hand, but they should be simple enough
to understand when something goes wrong.

## Desired First-Run Flow

This is the complete happy path we should optimize for:

```sh
ssh root@203.0.113.10
curl -fsSL https://singleserver.com/install.sh | sh
singleserver init --domain deploy.example.com --email me@example.com
singleserver github connect
singleserver add me/homepage --host example.com --host www.example.com --deploy
```

Then:

```sh
git push
```

The push should deploy the app and set a GitHub commit status.

## Roadmap

Status key:

- **Built:** works in the current codebase.
- **Partial:** exists, but the user experience is not yet the ideal flow.
- **Needed:** not built yet.

| Experience | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Central `apps.yml` allowlist | Built | Pushes for unlisted repos are ignored. |
| GitHub App push deploys | Built | The GitHub App provides webhooks and installation tokens. |
| Generated Kamal config | Built | Repos do not need `config/deploy.yml` unless they want custom behavior. |
| `singleserver add` | Partial | Adds apps, validates GitHub access, checks `Dockerfile`, supports hosts and optional deploy. DNS automation is not built. |
| `singleserver doctor` | Partial | Checks daemon, config, GitHub App access, checkouts, deploy config, last deploy, and healthchecks. Needs disk, Docker, proxy, and DNS checks. |
| Installer script | Needed | Should install Docker, Kamal, Single Server, systemd service, and base config. |
| `singleserver init` | Needed | Should configure ingress, public URL, email, and host environment. |
| `singleserver github connect` | Needed | Today the setup page exists; the CLI should wrap the flow. |
| DNS provider integration | Needed | Cloudflare should be first. Direct DNS instructions should remain possible. |
| Ingress setup | Needed | Current production uses host-level cloudflared. The installer should make this reproducible. |
| App domain management | Needed | Add/remove hosts after app creation. |
| App environment variables | Needed | Central server-side env/secrets management. |
| Persistent storage | Needed | First-class storage mounts and SQLite backup/restore. |
| Runtime logs | Needed | Deploy logs exist; app container logs need a CLI path. |
| App removal | Needed | Remove config, proxy routes, containers, and optionally DNS/storage. |
| Upgrade command | Needed | Pull releases, restart service, and run `doctor`. |
| Provider-specific server provisioning | Needed | Optional later step: create Hetzner/DO/AWS/Azure instances directly from Single Server. |

## Product Principles

- GitHub is the event source, not the deploy runner.
- The server is the deploy control plane.
- `apps.yml` is the source of truth for what can deploy.
- App repositories should stay boring: code plus `Dockerfile`.
- Secrets stay on the server.
- Every app gets its own container.
- Defaults should handle most apps.
- Overrides should be explicit and visible.
- The system should be inspectable with normal Linux tools.
